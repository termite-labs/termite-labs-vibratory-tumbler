# 3d-printed-vibratory-tumbler

Termite Labs - 3D Printed Vibratory Tumbler - Micro V0.5

This is a small vibratory tumbler I put together with my 3D printer and parts I had available at home, but the goal is create an open source, affortable, easy to print and assemble vibratory tumbler, useful for finsishing and polishing 3D printed parts or other objects.

# !!! WARNING !!!
This projects features a rapidly spinning electric motor with a 3d printed part attached to it. __This can dangerous and you need to be careful.__ __DO NOT ASSUME THIS IS SAFE.__

## Printing the parts

* [Base - V0.5 STL]()
* [Top - V0.5 STL]()
* [Weight - Part A - V0.5 STL]()
* [Weight - Part B - V0.5 STL]()

I printed my parts in eSun PLA+, 0.3mm layer height and medium speed for my printer. I recommend to use high setting for your layer height as it should make the parts stronger, at the cost of aesthetics. 

_(I designed this using Fusion 360, but I can't share the project to be edited by others because I'm using the free "hobby" version. Here is a [read-only link to the Fusion design](). Shout if you know how to fix this)_

## Non-printed parts

* 1x Motor
* 4x Springs
* Nx My XXmm Screws with bolts
* Nx Washers
* 2x lengths of wire
* 1x 12 Power Adapater
* Rubber Feet
* Tumbling Media

### Motor

 I used what I had around. There is probably a better choice out there, but this seems to work for now with a small modification (explained below in the instructions). One great thing is that the existing counterweight doubles as a hook to attach our own counterweight.

 The parts are designed specifically around this motor, so unfortunaely you'll have to get exactly this part. I provided links for Amazon US and UK. If you find this part in other countries, or not on Amazon, please let me know and I can add it here.

### Springs

The parts are designed specifically for springs of this size. I provided links for Amazon US and UK. If you find this part in other countries, or not on Amazon, please let me know and I can add it here.
