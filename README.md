Termite Labs 3D Printed Vibratory Tumbler

Open Source 3D Printed Vibratory Tumbler, Version 0.5

This is a small vibratory tumbler I put together with my 3D printer and parts I had available at home, but the goal is create an open source, affortable, easy to print and assemble vibratory tumbler, useful for finsishing and polishing 3D printed parts or other objects.

## 3D Models

I printed my parts in eSun PLA+, 0.3mm layer height and medium speed for my printer. I recommend to use high setting for your layer height as it should make the parts stronger, at the cost of aesthetics. 

I created the models using Fusion 360, but I can't share the project to be edited by others because I'm using the free "hobby" version. Here is a read-only link. I would appreciate any advice on how to improve this.

## Parts

### Motor

This is the key component of the project. I used what I had around and adapted to it. I'm sure there is a better choice out there.
